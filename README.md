# Polynomial Regression

This repository contains an implementation of Polynomial Linear Regression using Python. The model demonstrates how to extend simple linear regression to account for non-linear relationships between features and the target variable by introducing polynomial features.

## Introduction

Polynomial Linear Regression is a variation of linear regression where the relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y) is modeled as an nth degree polynomial. This approach allows the model to capture more complex, non-linear relationships. This notebook explores how to implement such a model, fit it to a dataset, and make predictions.
## Results

After training the model, we will see how well the polynomial regression fits the data compared to a simple linear regression. Visualization of the model's predictions is included in the notebook to aid in understanding the results.
